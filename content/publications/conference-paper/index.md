abstract: |
  Gallium oxide (β-Ga2O3) has emerged as a promising candidate for non-volatile resistive switching devices. We investigated the synthesis of crystalline β-Ga2O3 on Ru/Al2O3 substrates using RF magnetron sputtering and characterized Al/Ga2O3/Ru devices. The devices demonstrated stable bipolar resistive switching with ON/OFF ratios up to 10^3 and endurance over 70 cycles. Growth temperature and film thickness were shown to significantly influence stability and transport mechanisms. Results indicate filamentary conduction based on oxygen vacancy dynamics, making these devices promising candidates for next-generation resistive random access memory (ReRAM).

summary: "Presented at IEEE NMDC 2023: Stable β-Ga2O3 memristive devices grown by RF sputtering, showing ON/OFF ratios up to 10^3."
