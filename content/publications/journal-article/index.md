  This work investigates the structural evolution and nucleation dynamics of RF sputtered Ga2O3 thin films on Ru(0001), focusing on the influence of deposition temperature and Ru surface morphology. The study provides key insights into film crystallinity, interface stability, and growth mechanisms critical for non-volatile memory applications.

summary: "Study of Ga2O3 film growth on Ru(0001), highlighting deposition temperature and surface morphology effects for memory devices."

  In this work, we demonstrate the growth and resistive switching behavior of Î²-Ga2O3 thin films on Ru/Al2O3 substrates using magnetron RF sputtering. The devices exhibit bipolar resistive switching with ON/OFF ratios up to 10^4, stable endurance, and long retention times. Structural, morphological, and chemical analyses confirm conductive filament formation governed by oxygen vacancies, making these devices promising prototypes for next-generation nonvolatile memory.

summary: "Demonstration of Ga2O3-based memristive devices with stable resistive switching and promising memory performance."
