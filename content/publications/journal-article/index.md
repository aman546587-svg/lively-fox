abstract: |
  This work investigates the structural evolution and nucleation dynamics of RF sputtered Ga2O3 thin films on Ru(0001), focusing on the influence of deposition temperature and Ru surface morphology. The study provides key insights into film crystallinity, interface stability, and growth mechanisms critical for non-volatile memory applications.

summary: "Study of Ga2O3 film growth on Ru(0001), highlighting deposition temperature and surface morphology effects for memory devices."
